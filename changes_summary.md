# Project Changes and Troubleshooting Summary

## Changes Made

1. Updated `.prettierrc` file:
   ```json
   {
     "tabWidth": 2,
     "useTabs": false,
     "endOfLine": "lf"
   }
   ```

2. Added `.editorconfig` file:
   ```ini
   root = true

   [*]
   end_of_line = lf
   insert_final_newline = true
   ```

3. Updated Git configuration:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```

4. Verified `package.json` contents:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "website",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "private": true,
     "scripts": {
       "## DOCKER ##": "",
       "website": "docker compose --file docker-compose.website.yml --project-name website up -d --force-recreate --build website",
       "logs": "docker container logs website -f -n 100",
       "lint": "next lint",
       "## LOCAL/CODESPACE ##": "",
       "dev": "NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev",
       "start": "next start",
       "build": "next build"
     },
     // ... rest of the file
   }
   ```

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Addressed Prettier errors related to line endings:
   - Updated `.prettierrc` to use LF line endings.
   - Added `.editorconfig` to enforce LF line endings.
   - Changed Git configuration to handle line endings consistently.

2. Attempted to resolve "Missing script: "build"" error:
   - Verified that `package.json` contains the correct `build` script.
   - Suggested clearing npm cache and reinstalling dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm cache clean --force
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```

3. Addressed "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'D:\web\.next\BUILD_ID'" error:
   - Suggested deleting the `.next` directory and rebuilding:
     ```bash
     rm -rf .next
     npm run build
     ```

## Current Status

- Prettier errors related to line endings should be resolved.
- The `build` script is present in `package.json`, but npm is not recognizing it for an unknown reason.
- The Next.js build process is not completing successfully, as evidenced by the missing `BUILD_ID` file.
- There's a YAML syntax error in the `.drone.yml` file, unrelated to the main build issues.

## Next Steps

1. Verify that `package.json` changes are saved and recognized by npm:
   - Double-check file contents.
   - Try running `npm run` to list available scripts.

2. Investigate why npm is not recognizing the `build` script:
   - Check for any error messages when running `npm install`.
   - Verify Node.js and npm versions match those specified in `package.json`:
     ```json
     "engines": {
       "node": "v21.4.0",
       "npm": "10.2.4"
     }
     ```

3. Debug the Next.js build process:
   - Run `npm run build` and capture the full output.
   - Check for any error messages or warnings during the build process.

4. If issues persist, consider:
   - Creating a minimal Next.js project to compare configurations.
   - Updating Next.js and related dependencies to the latest compatible versions.
   - Checking for any conflicting global npm configurations.

5. Fix the YAML syntax error in `.drone.yml`:
   - Remove or merge duplicate `trigger` sections.

## Conclusion

While we've addressed some issues related to code formatting and consistency, there are still underlying problems with the npm script recognition and Next.js build process. The root cause appears to be a disconnect between the `package.json` file and what npm is recognizing. This could be due to caching issues, file saving problems, or npm configuration issues. Further investigation is needed to fully resolve these issues and get the project building and running successfully.
